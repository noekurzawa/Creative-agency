# Creative-agency

https://noekurzawa.github.io/Creative-agency/

This is my fifth project done myself.
I used only HTML and CSS and little JS.

This project taught me: smooth arrangement of elements into a layout, good practice - first think what you want to achieve in the project and how it should look and where it should be.
